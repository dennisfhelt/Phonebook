# Phonebook
shows phone numbers of family and friends

Keeping track all information in our daily live is a chore. It would be nice if we could get phone numbers and addresses in one place. In order to do that we need to allow users to update their info, while keeping others from updating other users' information with their ideas of it. Also, we might need an administrator to enter information for those who are unwilling or unable to enter it themselves. 

Some of the capabilities that may be needed include:
  Adding phone numbers, subtracting phone numbers, adding addresses, adding mobile phones, adding, editing and deleting users and other information. 
  
There would also be a need to display information in a form that the others could use:
  Drop down lists of other users' info, search for that info, an alphabetical listing, etc.
