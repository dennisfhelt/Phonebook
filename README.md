# Phonebook
Phonebook shows phone numbers of family and friends!

Keeping track of all information in our daily lives is a chore. It would be nice if we could get phone numbers and addresses in one place. In order to do that we need to allow users to update their info, while keeping others from updating other users' information incorrectly. Also, we need an administrator to enter information for those who are unwilling or unable to enter it themselves.

Some of the capabilities needed include:
Adding, editing and deleting users & their phone numbers and addresses and REST Service to get all contact information.

There would also be a need to display information in a form that the others could use:
Alphabetical listing of each user by last name with address and phone number information.
